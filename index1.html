    <h1>Designing an Inclusive Onboarding Experience for New Bus Passengers in Singapore</h1>
    <div class="meta">Final Project — Human-Centred Design / HealthTech Design — short brief (≈220–260 words)</div>
    <div class="brief">
This research investigates how to design an inclusive, low-friction onboarding experience for first-time bus users in Singapore. Despite a mature fare system (EZ-Link / SimplyGo) and widely available trip-planning apps, new passengers — tourists, recent migrants, elderly users, and infrequent riders — still face barriers: unclear card setup and top-up flows, uncertainty about exact bus timings and routes, and confusion at bus stops and transfers. The study will map the onboarding journey end-to-end, identify high-friction touchpoints through contextual interviews and ride-alongs, and prototype a layered onboarding system combining micro-tutorials, contextual prompts at bus stops, and a simplified “first trip” mode in existing apps or kiosks. Evaluation will use mixed methods: usability testing of prototypes (task success, time-to-board), short in-field pilots for behaviour change (tap usage, missed-stop rates), and qualitative feedback from diverse passenger groups. Expected outcomes include a prioritized set of design interventions (e.g., simplified EZ-Link pairing flow, signage tweaks, personalized push-notifications for first-time routes) and measurable metrics to guide transit operators and app teams. The research aims to improve confidence and reduce cognitive load for new riders while keeping operational feasibility and data privacy at the forefront.
